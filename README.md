Recoded the printf function. It works with the following flags:

```%c``` : prints an ascii character
```%p``` : prints the memory address of the argument
```%s``` : prints a string
```%d``` : prints a number
```%i``` : same as d
```%u``` : prints unsigned int
```%o``` : prints the number in octal (base 8)
```%x``` : prints the number in hexadecimal (base 16) with small letters
```%X``` : same as x but with big letters
```%f``` : prints floats
**Bonuses**
```%b``` : prints the number in binary (base 2)
```%a``` : prints a NULL-terminated 2d array (char**)
